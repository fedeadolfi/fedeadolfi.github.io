The principal focus of the paper is the relationship between neuroscience and psychology. The direction in which that research had proceeded, and continues now, is, in his view, fundamentally misguided. Building on the critique, Buzsáki presents arguments for an 'inside-out' approach, wherein the study of neurobiological objects has primacy over using psychological concepts to study the brain, and should, in fact, give rise to them. We argue that he is too pessimistic, and actually not quite right, about how the relation between cognition and neuroscience can be studied. Second, we are not in agreement with the normative recommendation of how to proceed: a predominantly brain first, implementation-driven research agenda. Finally, we raise concerns about the philosophical underpinning of the research program he advances. Buzsáki's perspective merits careful examination, and we suggest that it can be linked in a productive way to ongoing research, aligning his inside-out approach with current work that yields convincing accounts of mind and brain.","tags":null,"title":"Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware: The Brain from Inside Out, Turned Upside Down","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How the ÆPH does cognitive neuroscience make progress? A guide to an ongoing discussion I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in discussions lately (more than usual anyway) about how we make progress in neuroscience and cognitive science, and how the synergy is supposed to work. These issues have always been on my mind but it was just recently that we were encouraged to put our cards on the table and our thoughts in writing. David Poeppel and I just published a paper in the journal eNeuro, which you can find open acccess  here. The title is Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the title–absolutely not a title with a colon in it, nope.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s already a mouthful, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna call it ÆPH for short (like the æph word).\nÆPH makes some points we think apply broadly, although it\u0026rsquo;s largely in response to Gyuri Buszaki\u0026rsquo;s recent opinion paper, which itself was a response to *waves at all of psychology and cognitive neuroscience* whole swaths of research over the years. But ours is also a reaction to some of the \u0026lsquo;collateral\u0026rsquo; in Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s books. And on top of that there\u0026rsquo;s an editorial by Christoph Bernard, and a discussion on Paul Middlebrook\u0026rsquo;s Brain Inspired podcast.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing back and forth thing that may be hard to keep track of if you are busy with, well, *gestures at our apocalypsed world* all of this.\nI thought I would help you there and provide some guidance to navigate these arguments. Without elaborating too much I will also mention some takeaways and outstanding questions, in case you would like to think along. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep this updated as it develops.\nLinks:   Calling names – Christoph Bernard  The editorial presenting the following 2 papers and reflecting on the issue of naming.    The Brain–Cognitive Behavior Problem: A Retrospective – György Buzsáki  Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s piece from 20 years ago, where he lays down a very critical view of psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The arguments there are unpacked in more subtle and interesting ways in Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s later books.    Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware – David Poeppel \u0026amp; Federico Adolfi  Our piece, reacting to Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s article but also considering the latest developments of his ideas.    Podcast discussion – Brain Inspired  Here David and Gyuri join Paul Middlebrooks to discuss in real time the substance of the disagreements (and with surprise questions by John Krakauer and Paul Cisek). I\u0026rsquo;ve clarified my understanding of Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s position and polished my own views from listening to this. I think you are going to find it a productive discussion.      The Brain from Inside Out – György Buszáki  If you only read Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s article above, it\u0026rsquo;s likely you\u0026rsquo;re not gonna get the full subtelties in his argument. You may even come out of it with an uncharitable interpretation. I recommend that you also read at least the parts of his book that are relevant to this discussion. He provides very nice summaries throughout, so you can quickly get a sense of what to pay attention to.     Once you\u0026rsquo;ve read all of the above, you may find some of the following clarifications and highlights useful.\nClarifications   I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some confusion about the level our critique operates on. There\u0026rsquo;s what we know and how we come to know it. Ours is not a criticism of a particular view of the brain, or about specific \u0026lsquo;inside-out\u0026rsquo; work in neuroscience–it is a critique of conclusions such as Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s about how such work comes about and contributes to progress. That is, we question the prescriptive discourse that emerges as collateral from the inside-out view (which we grant may be useful to different extents).\n  I sense that some of the disagreements stem from possibly profound differences in how non-human vs human neuroscience procede (cf. a discussion where one scientist has human language in mind while the other is thinking of rats in a maze). May work in theory but fails in practice if we don\u0026rsquo;t bridge this gap from both sides. But this point would require careful unpacking, which I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do here.\n  Still contentious   A point that Gyuri keeps making in different forms is that brain mechanisms should be the arbiters in how the mind works. This harks back to a point we make in our article: there appears to be a hierarchy of evidence in how Gyuri sees progress, where brain data is better at arbitrating between candidate explanations of cognitive processes.\n  There\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of criticism about the terms in psychology and cognitive science. But does neuroscience have its \u0026lsquo;parts list\u0026rsquo; correctly identified? We believe alignment is important, and it can only come if neither cognitive science nor neuroscience have their parts lists entrenched, but take them to be hypotheses that can be ruled out using evidence from multiple qualitatively distinct sources.\n  Can cognitive science decompose its subject matter in a meaningful way without grounding to the brain? Gyuri seems to think not.\n  Although Gyuri readily admits that there\u0026rsquo;s no observation that happens in a vaccum and there\u0026rsquo;s always background information, I think the illusion of an independent brain observation is still implicit in the logic of arguments we\u0026rsquo;ve heard so far. You can hear an example in the podcast where an electrode in the rat hippocampus helps rule out an explanation of behavior.\n  There are lots of interesting points to develop, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it here for now. I\u0026rsquo;d rather make room for and hear your thoughts.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7ba08666c4c8fa75df408be72c5e35db","permalink":"https://fedeadolfi.github.io/post/blogpost_1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/blogpost_1/","section":"post","summary":"How the ÆPH does cognitive neuroscience make progress?
