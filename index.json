For many researchers in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI), the full observability and perturbability of ANNs trained on complex tasks affords a shortcut to domain insights, cognitive theories, neurocognitive models, application improvement, and user safety. Folklore intuitions, however, are typically disconnected from other relevant knowledge. Here we examine these intuitions formally by drawing relevant connections to computational complexity theory. We model interpretability queries computationally and analyze their resource demands for biological/artificial high-level cognition. We prove mathematically that, contrary to folklore, basic circuit-finding queries in classic ANNs are already infeasibly demanding to answer even approximately. We discuss how interdisciplinary integration can mitigate this disconnect and situate the broader implications for the cognitive sciences, the philosophy of AI-fueled discovery, and AI ethics.","tags":null,"title":"Complexity-theoretic limits on ANN reverse-engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Adolfi","Jeffrey Bowers","David Poeppel"],"categories":null,"content":"  section { background: white; color: black; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; left: 50% } #inner { display: inline-block; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center }           --  ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"200b2ebb0feef3138b8e7c62ae625d68","permalink":"https://fedeadolfi.github.io/publication/adolfi-ann-speech-2023/","publishdate":"2020-08-10T16:59:01.486078Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adolfi-ann-speech-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Natural and artificial audition can in principle acquire different solutions to a given problem. The constraints of the task, however, can nudge the cognitive science and engineering of audition to qualitatively converge, suggesting that a closer mutual examination would potentially enrich artificial hearing systems and process models of the mind and brain. Speech recognition — an area ripe for such exploration — is inherently robust in humans to a number transformations at various spectrotemporal granularities. To what extent are these robustness profiles accounted for by high-performing neural network systems? We bring together experiments in speech recognition under a single synthesis framework to evaluate state-of-the-art neural networks as stimulus-computable, optimized observers. In a series of experiments, we (1) clarify how influential speech manipulations in the literature relate to each other and to natural speech, (2) show the granularities at which machines exhibit out-of-distribution robustness, reproducing classical perceptual phenomena in humans, (3) identify the specific conditions where model predictions of human performance differ, and (4) demonstrate a crucial failure of all artificial systems to perceptually recover where humans do, suggesting alternative directions for theory and model building. These findings encourage a tighter synergy between the cognitive science and engineering of audition.","tags":null,"title":"Successes and critical failures of neural networks in capturing human-like speech recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Adolfi","Todd Wareham","Iris van Rooij"],"categories":[],"content":"  section { background: white; color: black; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; left: 50% } #inner { display: inline-block; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center }           --  ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649620573,"objectID":"76474f68db280223f342c1a4b22ed3fa","permalink":"https://fedeadolfi.github.io/publication/adolfi-computational-complexity-segmentation-2022/","publishdate":"2022-04-10T19:56:12.818225Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adolfi-computational-complexity-segmentation-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Computational feasibility is a widespread concern that guides the framing and modeling of biological and artificial intelligence. The specification of cognitive system capacities is often shaped by unexamined intuitive assumptions about the search space and complexity of a subcomputation. However, a mistaken intuition might make such initial conceptualizations misleading for what empirical questions appear relevant later on. We undertake here computational-level modeling and complexity analyses of segmentation - a widely hypothesized subcomputation that plays a requisite role in explanations of capacities across domains - as a case study to show how crucial it is to formally assess these assumptions. We mathematically prove two sets of results regarding hardness and search space size that may run counter to intuition, and position their implications with respect to existing views on the subcapacity.","tags":["Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science - Computational Complexity","F.2.0","Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition"],"title":"Computational Complexity of Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in discussions lately (more than usual anyway) about how we make progress in neuroscience and cognitive science, and how the synergy is supposed to work. These issues have always been on my mind but it was just recently that we were encouraged to put our thoughts in writing. David Poeppel and I just published a paper in the journal eNeuro, which you can find open acccess  here. The title is Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware (ÆPH) and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the title–absolutely not a title with a colon in it, nope.\nThe discussion so far hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a straight path to clean conclusions. ÆPH makes some points we think apply broadly, although it\u0026rsquo;s largely in response to Gyuri Buszaki\u0026rsquo;s recent opinion paper, which itself was a response to *waves at all of psychology and cognitive neuroscience* whole swaths of research over the years. But ours is also a reaction to some of the \u0026lsquo;collateral\u0026rsquo; in Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s books. And on top of that there\u0026rsquo;s an editorial by Christoph Bernard, and a discussion on Paul Middlebrooks\u0026rsquo;s Brain Inspired podcast.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing back-and-forth thing that may be hard to keep track of if you are busy with, well, *gestures at our apocalypsed world* all of this.\nI thought I would help you there and provide some guidance to navigate these arguments. Without elaborating too much I will also mention some takeaways and outstanding questions, in case you would like to think along. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep this updated as it develops.\nLinks:   Calling names – Christoph Bernard  The editorial presenting the following 2 papers and reflecting on the issue of naming.    The Brain–Cognitive Behavior Problem: A Retrospective – György Buzsáki  Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s piece from 20 years ago, where he lays down a very critical view of psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The arguments there are unpacked in more subtle and interesting ways in Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s later books.    Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware – David Poeppel \u0026amp; Federico Adolfi  Our piece, reacting to Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s article but also considering the latest developments of his ideas.    Podcast discussion – Brain Inspired  Here David and Gyuri join Paul Middlebrooks to discuss in real time the substance of the disagreements (with surprise questions by John Krakauer and Paul Cisek). I\u0026rsquo;ve clarified my understanding of Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s position and polished my own views from listening to this. I think you are going to find it a productive discussion.      The Brain from Inside Out – György Buszáki  If you only read Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s article above, it\u0026rsquo;s likely you\u0026rsquo;re not gonna get the full subtelties in his argument, and perhaps form an uncharitable opinion. I recommend that you also read at least the parts of his book that are relevant to this discussion. He provides very nice summaries throughout, so you can quickly get a sense of what to pay attention to.     Once you\u0026rsquo;ve read all of the above, you may find some of the following useful to narrow down the scope of the disagreements.\nClarifications   I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some confusion about the level our critique operates on. There\u0026rsquo;s what we know and how we come to know it. Ours is not a criticism of a particular view of how the brain works, or about specific \u0026lsquo;inside-out\u0026rsquo; work in neuroscience–it is a critique of conclusions such as Gyuri\u0026rsquo;s about how such work comes about and how contributes to progress. We question the prescriptive discourse that has emerged as collateral from the inside-out view.\n  I sense that some of the disagreements stem from possibly profound differences in how non-human vs human neurosciences procede (cf. discussions where one scientist is thinking of the capactity for language while the other is thinking of rats running in a maze). We need to bridge this gap from both sides.\n  Still contentious   A point that Gyuri keeps making in different forms is that brain \u0026lsquo;stuff\u0026rsquo; should be the arbiter in how the mind works. This harks back to a point we make in our article: there appears to be a hierarchy of evidence in how Gyuri sees progress, where brain data is better at arbitrating between candidate explanations of cognitive processes.\n  There\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of criticism about the terms in psychology and cognitive science. But does neuroscience have its \u0026lsquo;parts list\u0026rsquo; correctly identified? We believe alignment is important, and it can only come if neither cognitive science nor neuroscience have their parts lists entrenched, but take them to be hypotheses that can be ruled out using evidence from multiple qualitatively distinct sources.\n  Can cognitive science decompose its subject matter in a meaningful way without grounding to the brain? Gyuri seems to think not.\n  Although Gyuri readily admits there\u0026rsquo;s no observation that happens in a vaccum, I think the illusion of an independent, unbiased brain observation (where the \u0026ldquo;grounding\u0026rdquo; comes from) is still implicit in the structure of the arguments we\u0026rsquo;ve heard so far. You can hear a historical example in the podcast where an electrode in the rat hippocampus helps rule out an explanation of behavior.\n   ","date":1601596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601596800,"objectID":"686bb70ad25e051e2e55ec9d19c0f55f","permalink":"https://fedeadolfi.github.io/post/hidden/blogpost_1/","publishdate":"2020-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hidden/blogpost_1/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in discussions lately (more than usual anyway) about how we make progress in neuroscience and cognitive science, and how the synergy is supposed to work.

The principal focus of the paper is the relationship between neuroscience and psychology. The direction in which that research had proceeded, and continues now, is, in his view, fundamentally misguided. Building on the critique, Buzsáki presents arguments for an 'inside-out' approach, wherein the study of neurobiological objects has primacy over using psychological concepts to study the brain, and should, in fact, give rise to them. We argue that he is too pessimistic, and actually not quite right, about how the relation between cognition and neuroscience can be studied. Second, we are not in agreement with the normative recommendation of how to proceed: a predominantly brain first, implementation-driven research agenda. Finally, we raise concerns about the philosophical underpinning of the research program he advances. Buzsáki's perspective merits careful examination, and we suggest that it can be linked in a productive way to ongoing research, aligning his inside-out approach with current work that yields convincing accounts of mind and brain.","tags":null,"title":"Against the Epistemological Primacy of the Hardware","type":"publication"}]
